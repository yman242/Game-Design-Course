/*
Use in the Draw Event to draw the trail
scriptDrawTrail(trail,w1,w2,c1,c2,a1,a2)
Uses draw_line_width to draw lines between the points of the trail.
Also uses draw_set_color() and draw_set_alpha(), so be sure to change the drawing color and alpha back to the desired values after calling the script if necessary
